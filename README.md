In the dataset, each gesture class has 1000 hand pose images of humans pointing in different directions. This dataset is collected by five persons who display each gesture two hundred times, and a total of 6000 images are collected. The gesture images in the dataset are gathered in the same pipeline as the above pipeline of pointing gesture recognition. 

This dataset is for "Augmented Pointing Gesture Estimation for Human-Robot Interaction".
